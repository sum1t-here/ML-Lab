    "# Why `if __name__ == '__main__':` is Essential for Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "On **Windows** and **macOS**, Python uses the `spawn` method to create new processes. This means each child process starts by importing the main module from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard, here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Main script runs** → Creates Process 1 and Process 2\n",
    "2. **Process 1 starts** → Imports the main module → Sees the process creation code → Creates MORE processes\n",
    "3. **Process 2 starts** → Imports the main module → Sees the process creation code → Creates MORE processes\n",
    "4. **Each new process** → Does the same thing → **Infinite loop of process spawning!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker_function():\n",
    "    print(\"Working...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    # This code ONLY runs in the main process\n",
    "    # Child processes will NOT execute this block\n",
    "    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker_function)\n",
    "    p1.start()\n",
    "    p1.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you run the script directly: `__name__` equals `'__main__'` → Code inside the guard runs\n",
    "- When a child process imports the module: `__name__` equals the module name → Code inside the guard is **skipped**\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents child processes from spawning their own children.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Platform Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Platform | Default Method | Needs Guard? |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Windows** | `spawn` | ✅ **Required** |\n",
    "| **macOS** | `spawn` | ✅ **Required** |\n",
    "| **Linux** | `fork` | ⚠️ Recommended (best practice) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Linux uses `fork` by default (which doesn't re-import the module), it's still best practice to always use the guard for cross-platform compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistake\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ WRONG - Will cause infinite process spawning\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    print(\"Work\")\n",
    "\n",
    "p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n",
    "p.start()\n",
    "p.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ CORRECT - Safe from infinite spawning\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    print(\"Work\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n",
    "    p.start()\n",
    "    p.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always define functions at module level (outside the guard) and put process creation code inside the guard!**"
